Retirement calculator
Create a program that determines how many years you have left until 
retirement and the year you can retire. It should prompt for your 
current age and the age you want to retire and display the output as shown in 
the example that follows on the next slide
===================================slide info=================================
What is your age? 25
At what age would you like to retire? 65
You have 40 years left until you can retire.
It's 2020, so you can retire in 2060
===============================================
input1: Enter your age.
input2: When would you like to retire (year)
Constraints1: First we should change the the prompt value into Date.
Constraints: We have to consider the months too. because if someone is born in 
December 2000 it means he should be 20 year old not 21 in the year 2021.
we have to validate the date. Weather a currect date is provided or not.
